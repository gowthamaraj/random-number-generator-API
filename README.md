# Random Number Generator API
> Build random number generator API and add a rate limiting service on top of it.

## Tasks
The API must accomplish the following prime tasks.
 - An API running which returns a random number . (referred to as API A )
 - An service which sits between users and the above API A which allows for the following:
    1. Endpoint for User signup. (just username and password)
    2. Endpoint for User authentication.
    3. Endpoint: /call_api Only callable by authenticated user. If the user is authenticated and has not exhausted itâ€™s rate limits, call API and return the answer back to the user. If a user is not authenticated or does not have api calls left, return 403.
    4. Endpoint: /see_remaining_limits Only callable by authenticated user. Returns how many requests are left for that user in that hour.
